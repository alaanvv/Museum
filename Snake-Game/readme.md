  This was made when **alaanvv** was already  
  one of the programming celestial creatures,  
  so, it's not as good as the other things he  
  could have done with that time  
  Because of this, this game was one of the greatest  
  shits he ever coded (it has nothing creative in it)  

  Legends use to say that someday he tried adding a  
  feature in which you could make the snake start going  
  back and it crashed his mind so much that he gave up
