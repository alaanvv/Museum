  Automatically "watches" your classes at Google Meet

  Made on the **Corona-Era**, when the classes were online  
  and **alaanvv** don't used to watch not even one, so he  
  needed a way to "automate" that
</div>

# ClassHack

My first useful code ever made.  
Paste it on the console or make this  
a extension to use.
When your teatcher say your name,  
it will identify the captions and answer  
it for you

---

## How to use it:

Replace the array with all the possibilities
of words that the captions can write your name
as (your name and similar words):  
name = ["alan", "ala", "a lá", "a lã"]  
Turn on the captions and paste the code in  
the console.

The folder contain two modes:
- "Alert" - create an alert  
- "Auto answer" - atomatically answer, just  
let the chat opened, replace ```awnser = ''```  
by what you will answer.
