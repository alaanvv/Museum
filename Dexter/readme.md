  This game was used for a evil plan once  
  **alaanvv** downloaded the **html** and **css**  
  behind facebook's login page and put it on his game  
  But in that time, he didn't know how to automaticaly send  
  the credencials to him  
  He told his friends that if they won the game, they would get a  
  code which worth **diamonds** (a virtual currency) on **Verse** server  
  The code was basicaly the email, followed by a dot, followed  
  by the password, and between each letter, two more random characters  

  Only one person got baited, but **alaanvv** didn't really done  
  nothing into his account
